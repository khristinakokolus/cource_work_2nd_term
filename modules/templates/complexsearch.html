            <p class="thicker">When you go to COMPLEX SEARCH, you can see there the parameters by which you can search
                for recipes: main ingredient, ingredients to include, ingredients to exclude, cuisine, diet,
                dish type. It is ESSENTIAL to choose the MAIN INGREDIENT and the NUMBER OF RECIPES you want from 1 to 10.

                that you need to cook the dishes, nutrition analysis of all recipes, and recipesâ€™ links. As for the
                nutrition analysis, you will get the bar charts with the percents of daily needs of the nutrients that
                are in the dish. PLEASE KEEP IN MIND that the normal percent is considered in the range from 0 to 100,
                after 100 it is too much and it is not healthy!</p>
